# What is Sergeant?
* Sergeant keep the schema synchronized in all database
* Return with status code which show whether or not the schema is identical to the schema in repository
* Sergeant is able to show the list of different objects
* Provide help in release process to make sure the schema has been released as it is in repository
* Generating schema version which is a snapshot of the actual state of the database
* Created schema version can be connected to specific git commit by providing sha1
* Ability to ignore objects from comparison by specifying the pattern

### Object types
Sergeant validate any differences on the following object types
* FN (function)
* FTI (full text index)
* IDX 	(index)
* IF	(inline function)
* P	(procedure)
* T	(table)
* TF	(table function)
* TVP	(table valued parameter)
* VW	(view)
 
# Usage

```
EXEC Sergeant.HashMatch [ [@version = ] { value }, [@showObjects =]  { 1 | 0 }]
```
 
# Example
```
DECLARE @ret INT
EXEC @ret = Sergeant.HashMatch @version = '10.2', @showObjects = 1
SELECT @ret
```

```
DECLARE @ret INT 
DECLARE @exception dbo.VC128
INSERT INTO @exception VALUES ('deleted_'),('tmp_')
EXEC @ret = Sergeant.HashMatch @exception = @exception 
SELECT @ret
```

# Schema Version
Before every release new schema version have to be generated by calling the following procedure

``` 
EXEC Sergeant.CreateDataVersion @version = {@version}, @sha1 = {@sha1}
```

Parameter description:
* @version: schema version short name, or number. (e.g major version number 10.2)
* @sha1: Created schema version should be connected to git commit through sha1. To get the sha1 type: git rev-parse develop
 
Generated Schema version will be traveling with the release so it can be use as benchmark in comparison.
 
Schema versions historically stored in table:

``` 
SELECT * FROM Sergeant.SchemaVersion AS dv
```
 
# Schema format
 

```
<objects>
  <object name="function1">
    <Type>FN </Type>

  </object>
  ...
